# 🧠 Feature Detection & Matching in Computer Vision

This project explores key feature detection and matching techniques used in computer vision. We implement and compare three foundational algorithms:
- **SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)**
- **Harris Corner Detection**
- **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)** for robust feature matching.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project is to detect and match key points between images using classical methods. These techniques are useful for applications such as image stitching, object recognition, panorama generation, and motion tracking.

## 📌 Algorithms Used

### 🔍 1. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
SIFT detects and describes local features in images. It's invariant to scale, rotation, and partially invariant to illumination and affine transformations.

**Steps Involved:**
- Keypoint detection using Difference of Gaussians
- Keypoint localization and orientation assignment
- Descriptor generation for each keypoint
- Matching keypoints across images using descriptor distances

### 🧱 2. Harris Corner Detection
A classical algorithm to detect corners — points where intensity changes in two directions. It is scale-variant but very fast and useful for finding interest points in structured environments (e.g., buildings).

**Key Concepts:**
- Measures local auto-correlation of gradient changes
- Detects strong edges and corners based on eigenvalue analysis of the second moment matrix

### 🎯 3. RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)
Used to estimate a geometric transformation (e.g., homography) between sets of matched points, while rejecting outliers. RANSAC helps filter out false matches for more robust alignment.

**Use Case in Project:**
- Applied after SIFT-based feature matching
- Estimates homography between two images
- Filters out noisy matches and retains only reliable correspondences
